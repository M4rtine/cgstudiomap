Res Groups Computer Graphics
============================
This module adds a new group: Computer Graphics.

This group allows user to see res.partner with the the res.partner.category cg.

The aim of the module is to not have the filter on the view but more on the orm itself.
This allows to have the same behaviour in the website and in the api.

A rule is set on res.partner to only see the partner related to Computer Graphics industry.
